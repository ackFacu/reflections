What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a .git folder where all the commits (changes and descriptions) will be saved.
	You need to do it to start using git in a specified folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It does not is a commit, you can't see it in git log. So it is just a intermediate state.
	It helps you to choose what files to save in a new commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Just add one file to the staging area and commit just that file.
