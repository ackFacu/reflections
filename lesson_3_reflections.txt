When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want to share you work, when you work together with orther people, or when you are going to
  work in two or more computres, and want to have it synced.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because if other colaborator make a change at the same time than you do, there will be a conflict

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Branch is a new line of time of the code, in the same repository.
	clone copys all the repository, with all the branches.
	forks is a clone that occurs inside github.
	You want to branch when you want to try some new code in your computer withoun breaking your main code.
	clone is when you want to have a repository that exist in other computer, in your own.
	fork is when you want to modify the repository of another person, without modyfing his own.
